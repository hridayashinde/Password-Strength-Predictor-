# Password-Strength-Predictor-
We use passwords everyday, infact every hour or minute to unlock our phones or log into out social media or bank accounts. Passwords are a very basic way to keep our information private and safe, therefore it is important to use passwords that are secure. I have used 4 different Machine Learning models to create a password predictor and check which model works best. I have implemented NLP concepts like TF-IDF and used these classifiers [Logistic, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest].
